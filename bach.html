        <p>Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He is known for instrumental compositions such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the Goldberg Variations, and for vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has generally been regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time.</p>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Bach was born in Eisenach, in the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, into a great musical family. His father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, was the director of the town musicians, and all of his uncles were professional musicians. Bach's mother and father both died when he was 10 years old. He was taken in by his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach, the organist at the Michaeliskirche in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.</p>
        <p>In 1703, he was appointed Kapellmeister (director of music) to Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, where he composed many instrumental works. In 1723, he moved to Leipzig, where he was appointed Cantor of the Thomasschule at Thomaskirche in Leipzig, Director of Music in the principal churches in the town, and teacher of Latin and music in the St. Thomas School. He remained there until his death.</p>
